The pdf above is a short leaflet from a famous book "Computer Networking : A Top-Down Approach". 
I have studied Data Transfer protocol in great detail from this book. A good protocol should be ensured 
that it is efficient and reliable data transfer mechanism before deploying it in our systems. Automata 
theory and the methods of formal verifications can be used for this purpose. What we do is to make a finite states
model for our protocol and then check where it fails.

I did this in my summer vacation. I also referred to the notes of professor Kameswari Chebrolu , IITB, India. 
They were also very helpful too.

One of the best applications of this idea to use Automata for verification of the protocol is the banking systems.
We all know about the E-money. For now we can consider it as a file. So every user has a account the money that the
user has in his account is represented by quantity of the files. So protocol decide when a file should be transferred.
It should ensure that the file is not present in different accounts or should never end up in such a state. This can be 
applied to the cheque systems also. 

You can refer to the book for these in great details.
Thank You
